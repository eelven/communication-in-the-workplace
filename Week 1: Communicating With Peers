Communicating With Peers

1.1 Communicating With Peers Part1 (4min)

2 types of communication: verbal and non-verbal
Verbal communication: occurs using spoken words.
Non-Verbal communication: includes body language,
specifically gestures and facial expressions and can also
include nonverbal aspects of verbal communications such as
the tone, pitch of your voice, and the speed in which you're
speaking.

2 other types of communication in the workplace.
Internal vs External communication
Internal communication: refers to communication that takes place
within the confines of your organization regardless of geography.
If you're interacting with anyone employed by your company, you
are communicating internally.
External communication: refers to communication which takes place
with anyone outside of your organization who's not an employee. These
are generally suppliers, customers, even the general public. There can
be some overlap with contractors, or onsite team members from closely
partnering organizations but for our discussions, we'll use employment
as the distiguishing factor between internal and external.
The last type of communication we'll consider is in-person communication, 
live with another person real time, or virtual communication, which takes
place using technology, either live or delayed.
